      <h1 style="color:var(--accent)">About This Project</h1>
      <p>The <strong>Female Body Shape Visualizer</strong> is a free, open-source tool designed to help women understand their body proportions and identify their body shape. By inputting measurements, users can generate a 3D model that visually represents their figure, along with a classification into common body types like Apple, Pear, Hourglass, and more.</p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>Our goal is to provide an accessible and intuitive tool that promotes body positivity and self-understanding. We believe that knowing your body shape is the first step toward dressing with confidence and developing effective fitness plans.</p>

      <h2>Technology</h2>
      <p>This project is built with <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>. The 3D visualization is powered by the <strong>Three.js</strong> library, which allows for dynamic rendering of the female body model based on user inputs.</p>

      <h2>Author</h2>
      <p>This project was created by <strong>Aritra</strong>. You can find more of my work on my <a href="https://github.com/aritra363">GitHub profile</a>.</p>

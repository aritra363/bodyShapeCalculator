    <h2>Spoon Body Shape – Definition, Characteristics & Styling Ideas</h2>

    <p>
      The <strong>Spoon Body Shape</strong> (also known as the <em>pear-top or bottom-heavy figure</em>)
      is one of the most feminine and curvy body types. It is characterized by <strong>fuller hips and thighs</strong>,
      a <strong>defined waist</strong>, and a slightly <strong>smaller bust and shoulders</strong>.
      Women with this body type naturally have a graceful lower-body dominance that creates
      a beautiful spoon-like silhouette.
    </p>

    <p>
      With our <strong>Female Body Shape Calculator and 3D Visualizer</strong>, you can
      determine if you have a spoon-shaped figure by entering your <em>bust, waist, and hip measurements</em>.
      The tool instantly generates a realistic 3D visualization of your proportions and
      provides custom <strong>fashion recommendations</strong> tailored for the spoon body shape.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Features of Spoon Body Type</h3>
    <ul class="seo-list">
      <li>Hips are noticeably wider than the bust and shoulders.</li>
      <li>Waist is well-defined and curves inward beautifully.</li>
      <li>Weight tends to accumulate around the lower belly, hips, or thighs.</li>
      <li>Shoulders are narrower compared to the lower half.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Styling Tips for Spoon Body Shape</h3>
    <p>
      The goal for spoon-shaped women is to <strong>balance the upper and lower body</strong>
      by drawing attention upward and defining the waist. Structured tops and layered outfits
      help achieve a more symmetrical look.
    </p>

    <ul class="seo-list">
      <li>Wear <strong>off-shoulder tops, boat necklines, or ruffled blouses</strong> to broaden the shoulders.</li>
      <li>Opt for <strong>A-line skirts, high-waisted jeans, or straight-leg trousers</strong> to elongate the legs.</li>
      <li>Use <strong>belts and wrap dresses</strong> to highlight the waistline.</li>
      <li>Choose darker shades for bottoms and brighter or printed tops for contrast.</li>
      <li>Layer with fitted jackets or blazers to create vertical balance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Confidence & Body Harmony</h3>
    <p>
      The <strong>Spoon body shape</strong> represents natural femininity and balance.
      When styled strategically, it enhances your curves while maintaining proportion and flow.
      With the right fabrics and silhouettes, spoon-shaped women can effortlessly
      highlight their best features and achieve a graceful, confident appearance.

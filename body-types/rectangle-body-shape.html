    <h2>Rectangle Body Shape – Definition, Measurements & Styling Guide</h2>

    <p>
      The <strong>Rectangle Body Shape</strong> (also known as the <em>straight or athletic body shape</em>)
      is characterized by a balanced silhouette with <strong>minimal curves</strong>. The bust, waist,
      and hips are nearly the same width, resulting in a straight or rectangular outline.
      This body type is admired for its clean lines and versatility in styling.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using our <strong>Female Body Shape Calculator & 3D Visualizer</strong>, you can quickly determine
      if you have a rectangular body shape by entering your <em>bust, waist, and hip measurements</em>.
      Instantly visualize your figure and receive personalized fashion tips to enhance your proportions.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Traits of Rectangle Body Shape</h3>
    <ul class="seo-list">
      <li>Bust, waist, and hips have similar measurements.</li>
      <li>Waistline is not distinctly defined.</li>
      <li>Shoulders and hips are evenly aligned.</li>
      <li>Weight is evenly distributed across the body.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Styling Tips for Rectangle Body Type</h3>
    <p>
      For women with a rectangle or athletic figure, the goal is to <strong>create the illusion of curves</strong>
      and add definition to the waist. Outfits that emphasize the bust and hips while cinching the waistline
      help balance the overall look.
    </p>

    <ul class="seo-list">
      <li>Opt for <strong>belted dresses, wrap tops, and peplum blouses</strong> to highlight your waist.</li>
      <li>Try <strong>flared skirts, bootcut jeans, or ruffled tops</strong> to add volume and femininity.</li>
      <li>Layering with fitted blazers or cropped jackets enhances body proportions.</li>
      <li>Choose <strong>textured or patterned fabrics</strong> to add depth and movement.</li>
      <li>Highlight your shoulders with halter or off-shoulder designs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Body Type Confidence & Styling Balance</h3>
    <p>
      The <strong>Rectangle body type</strong> exudes a naturally athletic and balanced appearance.
      With the right outfits and styling techniques, you can enhance your figure by defining curves
      and accentuating your waist. Embrace your proportions — your strength lies in structure, symmetry,
      and elegance.

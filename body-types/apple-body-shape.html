    <h2>Apple Body Shape – Complete Style, Measurement & Visual Guide</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Apple Body Shape</strong> is characterized by a fuller upper body —
      broad shoulders, prominent bust, and a less defined waistline.
      Women with this body type often have slender legs and arms, making their silhouette
      naturally elegant and proportionate when styled correctly.
    </p>

    <p>
      At <strong>Female Body Shape Visualizer</strong>, our <em>Apple body shape calculator</em>
      uses your <strong>bust, waist, and hip measurements</strong> to identify
      your figure type accurately. This helps you understand your proportions and
      visualize your unique body in 3D form using our advanced <strong>body shape visualizer tool</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Dressing for the Apple body type means focusing on balance. Choose <strong>V-neck tops,
      empire-line dresses, A-line skirts, and high-waisted trousers</strong> to draw attention
      away from the midsection and highlight your legs and neckline.
      Lightweight fabrics and vertical patterns help create an elongated look.
    </p>

    <h3>Styling Tips for Apple Body Shape</h3>
    <ul class="seo-list">
      <li>Opt for <strong>structured jackets</strong> to define your shoulders and waistline.</li>
      <li>Wear <strong>darker tops</strong> with lighter bottoms to balance proportions.</li>
      <li>Avoid clingy fabrics around the waist; instead, choose draped styles.</li>
      <li>Show off your <strong>legs with knee-length skirts or slim trousers</strong>.</li>
      <li>Accessorize with long necklaces to visually elongate your torso.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The <strong>Apple body shape</strong> is beautiful and confident — a symbol of
      strength, balance, and poise. With the right knowledge and outfits,
      you can highlight your best features and achieve timeless style harmony.

    <h2>Pear Body Shape – Styling Guide, Features & Measurement Insights</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Pear Body Shape</strong> — also known as the <em>triangle body shape</em> —
      features <strong>wider hips and thighs</strong> with a smaller bust and defined waist.
      Women with this figure have naturally feminine curves, giving them a balanced and graceful look
      when dressed according to their proportions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our <strong>Female Body Shape Calculator</strong> helps you identify if you have a
      pear-shaped figure using your <strong>bust, waist, and hip measurements</strong>.
      The integrated <em>3D body shape visualizer</em> instantly displays your body structure,
      providing you with deeper insights into styling choices and fit recommendations.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you’re pear-shaped, the key to styling is <strong>balancing your proportions</strong>.
      Choose tops that add volume to your shoulders and bust area — like <strong>boat necklines,
      puff sleeves, or layered tops</strong> — while keeping bottoms simple and structured.
      A-line skirts, straight-cut pants, and darker tones on the lower half will flatter your figure.
    </p>

    <h3>Style & Fashion Tips for Pear Body Shape</h3>
    <ul class="seo-list">
      <li>Highlight your <strong>waistline</strong> with fitted belts or wrap dresses.</li>
      <li>Wear <strong>bright or patterned tops</strong> to draw attention upward.</li>
      <li>Opt for <strong>wide-leg trousers</strong> or <strong>A-line skirts</strong> for balance.</li>
      <li>Avoid clingy fabrics around the hips; instead, use flowy materials.</li>
      <li><strong>Layer jackets or blazers</strong> to add proportion to your shoulders.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The <strong>Pear body type</strong> is one of the most common and classically feminine shapes.
      With the right fashion strategy, you can create harmony between your upper and lower body —
      enhancing your curves while maintaining a sleek silhouette.

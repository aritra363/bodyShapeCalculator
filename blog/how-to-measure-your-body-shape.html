    <h1>How to Measure Your Body Shape Correctly</h1>
    <p>Understanding your body shape starts with accurate measurements. This guide will help you take your bust, waist, and hip measurements correctly — all you need is a measuring tape and a mirror.</p>

    <h2>1. Measuring Your Bust</h2>
    <p>Wrap the tape measure around the fullest part of your bust, keeping it straight across your back. Don’t pull too tight — it should rest comfortably against your skin.</p>

    <h2>2. Measuring Your Waist</h2>
    <p>Find your natural waistline, which is usually the narrowest part of your torso (just above your belly button). Breathe normally and keep the tape snug but not tight.</p>

    <h2>3. Measuring Your Hips</h2>
    <p>Measure around the widest part of your hips and buttocks. Stand with your feet together to get an accurate reading.</p>

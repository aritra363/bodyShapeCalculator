    <h1>Fitness Tips for Different Body Types</h1>
    <p>Each body shape benefits from a specific kind of workout. Here’s how you can design your fitness plan:</p>
    <img src="https://femalebodyshape.infinityfree.me/assets/models/bell-front.png" alt="Model Front" style="width:100%;max-width:200px;border-radius:12px;box-shadow:0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);margin:16px 0;" />
    <img src="https://femalebodyshape.infinityfree.me/assets/models/banana-back.png" alt="Model back" style="width:100%;max-width:200px;border-radius:12px;box-shadow:0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);margin:16px 0;" />

    <h2>For Pear Shapes</h2>
    <p>Focus on upper-body strength and cardio to balance proportions.</p>

    <h2>For Apple Shapes</h2>
    <p>Core-strengthening and posture correction workouts help elongate your figure.</p>

    <h2>For Hourglass Figures</h2>
    <p>Full-body functional training maintains symmetry and muscle balance.</p>

    <h2>For Banana Shapes</h2>
    <p>For a banana (or ruler) body shape, the goal is to create more curves, broaden shoulders, and tighten the waist. Focus on strength training with compound lower body movements like deadlifts, step-ups, and squats to build glute and hip definition. Incorporate shoulder exercises such as chest presses and lateral raises to accentuate the shape around the shoulders. Abdominal exercises like planks are crucial for core tone. Include cardio like swimming or incline treadmill walking. A protein-rich diet with unrefined whole foods, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats is recommended.</p>

    <h2>For Bell Shapes</h2>
    <p>For a bell body shape (pear or triangle), the primary fitness goal is to create a more balanced silhouette by strengthening the upper body and toning the lower body. Prioritize upper body strength training with exercises like lateral raises, overhead presses, lat pull-downs, and bicep curls. For the lower body, focus on toning and sculpting with exercises like squats, lunges, hip thrusts, and deadlifts, using higher repetitions and lighter resistance if aiming for definition without bulk. Engage your core with planks and bicycle crunches. Incorporate HIIT for overall fat burning.</p>

    <h2>For Inverted Triangle Shapes</h2>
    <p>For an inverted triangle body shape, fitness goals revolve around balancing broader shoulders with a narrower waist and hips. Focus on strengthening and building muscle in the glutes, thighs, and hips with exercises like squats, deadlifts, hip thrusts, and lunges. For the upper body, aim for toning and strength without excessive bulk, using exercises like push-ups, inverted rows, and lighter lateral raises. Core exercises like planks and Russian twists help define the waistline. Include cardio for overall fat loss.</p>

    <h2>For Rectangle Shapes</h2>
    <p>For a rectangle body shape, fitness tips focus on creating the illusion of curves by building muscle in specific areas. Prioritize strength training to add definition to the upper and lower body. For the upper body, focus on exercises that build the shoulders and back, such as lat pulldowns and dumbbell rows. For the lower body, emphasize glute and thigh exercises like squats, lunges, and deadlifts to add volume. Core exercises are vital for overall health and posture. Include regular, moderate cardio for overall health and fat loss. Maintain a protein-rich diet.</p>

    <h2>For Spoon Shapes</h2>
    <p>For a spoon body shape, fitness tips focus on balancing the physique through targeted exercises and a mindful diet. To tone the lower body without adding bulk, focus on higher repetitions and lighter resistance for exercises like donkey kicks, V shape wide squats, and lunges. For the upper body, use moderate to high resistance for exercises like lunges with tricep extension and push-ups to create a more balanced silhouette. Incorporate cardiovascular exercise like brisk walking or HIIT. A diet rich in lean proteins, fiber-rich carbohydrates, and healthy fats is recommended, while reducing saturated fats and limiting sugars.</p>

    <h2>For Triangle Shapes</h2>
    <p>For a triangle body shape (pear shape), the goal is to balance the wider hips and thighs with narrower shoulders. Focus on toning the lower body and building strength and definition in the upper body. For the lower body, incorporate squats, lunges, glute bridges, and hip thrusts. For the upper body, include exercises that build muscle in the chest, back, and shoulders, such as dumbbell bench press, lat pulldowns, and shoulder presses. Core workouts are important for belly fat reduction and definition. Include cardio for overall fat loss.</p>

    <h2>For X-Shape Figures</h2>
    <p>For an X-shape body type (hourglass figure), fitness tips focus on enhancing natural proportions. Prioritize weight training 3-5 times a week. Focus on exercises that build width in the upper body (shoulders and lats) and lower body (glutes and thighs), while maintaining a defined waist. Examples include military press, lateral raises, lat pulldowns, squats, deadlifts, and hip thrusts. Core exercises like planks and bicycle crunches help define the waist without adding bulk. Incorporate strategic cardio for fat loss and maintain a balanced, protein-rich diet.</p>
